If the loop completes without finding any such pair, the array is a min heap.\n\nTo ensure the correctness of the function, you can use a simple check function with provided data points. Here's an example implementation:\n\n```python\ndef check_min_heap():\n    assert is_min_heap([3, 5, 7, 9]) == True, \"Test case 1 failed\"\n    assert is_min_heap([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == False, \"Test case 2 failed\"\n    assert is_min_heap([4, 2, 6, 3, 5]) == True, \"Test case 3 failed\"\n    assert is_min_heap([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == False, \"Test case 4 failed\"\n    print(\"All test cases passed!\")\n\ncheck_min_heap()\n```\n\nThis code snippet defines a function `is_min_heap` that checks if the input array is a min heap using the described logic. It also includes a `check_min_heap` function that uses assertions to verify the correctness of the `is_min_heap` function with various test cases.", "score": 0.625}

It initializes a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to paint the fence with `i` posts using `j` colors. The base case sets `dp[0][j]` to 1 because there's always exactly one way to paint the fence without any posts. For each subsequent post, it updates the DP table by considering the two possibilities: either the current post has the same color as the previous post or the previous post has the same color as the current post. The result is stored in `dp[n-1][k-1]`, which represents the number of ways to paint the fence with `n` posts using `k` colors.", "score": 0.375}
